- Animation Lab -

Just a collection animations for practice and inspiration

## Ideas to add

- SVG's (path animations and whole aniamtions)
- Different landing pages (get ideas from youtube, dribbble, awwwards, etc)
- Awwwards1 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIPgWIcEYHQ
- Timeline animations such as an intro "cutscene". Possibly include a "Click here to skip cutscene" type button
- Pin a circular menu like that one from framer motion twitter (https://twitter.com/Omarcodess/status/1341967217626411011 as well as https://codesandbox.io/s/scrolling-rotation-nfowt)
